## BR41N.IO Designers Hackathon Project

## Overview

This project analyses EEG data from stroke patients undergoing a Brain-Computer Interface Functional Electrical Stimulation (BCI-FES) rehabilitation therapy. The primary goals were:

1.  To evaluate and compare different BCI decoding pipelines for classifying Left vs. Right hand motor imagery (MI) in this challenging dataset.
2.  To assess the impact of the BCI-FES therapy on the decodability of MI signals by comparing performance on data recorded before (Pre) and after (Post) the therapy intervention.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 16-channel EEG recordings from 3 chronic stroke patients. For each patient, data is available from the first ('Pre') and last ('Post') sessions of a 25-session BCI-FES therapy program. Each session includes separate 'Training' and 'Testing' runs where the patient performed cued Left or Right hand motor imagery.

Data details:
*   Source: Derived from the study by Sebasti√°n-Romagosa et al. (provided dataset description).
*   Format: `.mat` files containing EEG data (`y`), trigger channel (`trig`), and sampling rate (`fs` = 256 Hz).
*   Task: Binary classification (Left MI vs Right MI).

## Repository Structure

*   `all_processed_data.pkl`: Python pickle file containing the loaded and epoched data (original and whitened). Generated by `phs_1.3_time_whitening.py`.
*   `detailed_results_p2_p3.pkl`: Pickle file with detailed outputs (labels, predictions, features) for P2/P3 from the best pipeline run. Generated by the modified Riemannian script.
*   `phs_1.*.py`: Scripts for initial data loading, epoching, and whitening (Phase 1).
*   `phs_2.*.py`: Scripts implementing and testing the different decoding pipelines (CSP+LDA, CSP+SVM, PCA+TVLDA, Riemannian).
*   `phs_4.*.py`: Scripts for generating visualisations (ERD/ERS, results plots, confusion matrices, t-SNE, topomaps).
*   `*.csv`: CSV files containing accuracy results for different pipeline runs.
*   `*.png`: Generated plot images.

## Conclusion

This project identified a high-performance BCI decoding pipeline for challenging stroke patient EEG data and demonstrated its utility in revealing potential therapy-induced neural changes.
